    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <p>irenical.org is an open platform, managed by professional software developers. A repository of
        knowledge and code that aims to solve software engineering problems common to several industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        It grants its contributors with a place for discussion and development of libraries and tools
        that allow faster and more agile development of software products, by reducing the development overhead
        caused by boilerplate that adds no business value.
    </p>
    <p>
        irenical.org projects and discussions do not aim to build products nor solve business problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>irenical.org is currently made up of the sparse effort of 10 software engineers
        employed in 3 different companies, focusing almost solely in java distributed systems.
        We should aim to cover other tech stacks and architectures.</p>
    <p>All discussions currently happens directly between the contributors, with no public log nor article
        exposing whichever conclusions.
        We should create a public platform to expose the non-code part of the work
    </p>
    <p>All projects currently exist in a <a href="https://github.com/irenical">GitHub group</a></p>
